# About
Hacklytics 2021 Submission - "COVID-19 Data Gig" Data Aggregation Project.

Despite the fact that there're many COVID-19 datasets out there,
there is a lack of publicly available datasets or analysis about COVID-19 hospitalization
data. We want to bridge this gap by creating a well-organized, clean
COVID-related hospitalization dataset that is publicly available to others and
also perform EDA on the aggregated datasets.

## Technologies Used
Data aggregation: Pandas

Data visualization: Plotly Python Graphing Library, searborn, Matplotlib

Development tool: Jupyter Notebook
